# Oxford Global Hackathon 2019

## Oxford Property Hackathon
The Problem: When constructing a large building, Oxford Property must go down thousands of line items of each individual material needed to build the site and source suppliers. Pricing and Quality controls can be difficult to maintain.

All this accomplished in 40hrs. Demo:
